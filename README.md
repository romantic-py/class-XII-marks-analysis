Till 2018 C.B.S.E. used to upload the class XII marks of all the schools on (now defunct) schoolcoderesults.nic.in, which could be downloaded as a text file named [schoolcode].txt where [schoolcode] is the unique School code given to schools by CBSE.

I downloaded the text file for my school. Using the above code I extracted meaningful data from it and analyzed the frequency of marks in various subjects. 
Using the code one can also get the subject toppers and also get a sorted ranklist of all the students.
